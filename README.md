Tim the Project Enchanter is know as "Tim" for short.

Tim puts the big nasty teeth in project generation.

Tim is a wxLua based GUI tool that allows users to store project templates in Subversion, then grab the template and fill in supported template arguments. After that Tim will commit the new project to another Subversion location.

P.S. Named after The Holy Grail "Tim the Enchanter" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZJZK6rzjns
